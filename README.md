Open Source Muzak

Initial work done in Logic Pro X, and includes the use of several proprietary plugins to see how well they translate to other DAW's.

## Goals

- Understand the structure of a project and find commonalities between popular DAW's (Logic, Pro Tools, Cubase, Sonar)
- Possibly create a "bootstrap" project configuration for aforementioned DAW's so that they can be easily/automatically exported to a reusable format for others to tinker with.
- Explore the possiblities of re-using plugins or creating some sort of a plugin package manager.  Does this track use Native Instruments Guitar Rig 5?  Run "apt-get my_plugin".
- Understand how Git treats audio files.  Are conflicts a regular occurance?  Are diff's even possible?
